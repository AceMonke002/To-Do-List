# To-Do List Manager

This is a simple graphical To-Do List Manager application built using Python and Tkinter. It allows users to add, remove, view, and mark tasks as completed. The tasks are saved in a JSON file and can be managed interactively with the GUI.

## Features:
- **Add Task**: Add new tasks to the list.
- **Remove Task**: Remove existing tasks from the list.
- **Mark Task as Complete**: Toggle the completion status of tasks.
- **View Tasks**: View all tasks with their completion status.
- **Persistence**: Tasks are saved in a `todo.json` file.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (comes with Python by default)
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)

## How to Run:
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install Python 3.x if you don't have it already: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. Run the following command to start the application:
    For Windows
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    For MacOS
    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```
4. The application window will open, and you can start managing your tasks!

## File Structure:
- `main.py`: The main Python file containing the To-Do list logic and GUI.
- `todo.json`: The file where your tasks are stored in JSON format.
